EDIT

A text editor based on uEmacs/PK 4.0 which is based on MicroEMACS 3.9.

The goal is to tweak this enough that it can become my personal text editor.
It is also intended to deviate quite a bit from the original source, and be
rewritten over time.

Given that it still has most of the original code, the copyright info for
that code can be found here:
